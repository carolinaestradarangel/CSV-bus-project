I did want to see a pattern of decline after the recession hit because I did think that would've affected the ridership, which it did show in the scatterplot. It Seems that the ridership has never been the same since the start of the pandemic two years later specifically even if it demonstrated the decline after 2008, the pandemic hit was severe for ridership.
